<h1> History </h1>
<!-- A short but brief history -->
<p> Pakistan was born on 14 August 1947, after a furious battle with the Indians and British. Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah, known as the founder of Pakistan, worked as the first governer general to establish the new nation's government rules and policies. Pakistan remianed in the Common Wealth until 1956, when it became a republic. A dictator rule was imposed from 1958 to 1969. Before 1970, Pakistan had fought 2 wars with India over the disputed territory of Kashmir. After the 1970's elections, a civil war broke out, and East Pakistan got seperated as an independent state named Bangladesh. Later, a series of millitary and democratic rulers ruled Pakistan. </p>
